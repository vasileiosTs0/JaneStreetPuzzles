Pick distinct positive integers A, B, and C, and place them in the grid above. Your goal is to create two corner-to-corner trips — one from a1 to f6, and the other from a6 to f1 — both of which score exactly 2024 points.

A “trip” consists of knight’s moves. Squares may not be revisited within a trip.

The “score” for a trip is calculated as follows:

Start with A points.
Every time you make a move:
if your move is between two different integers, multiply your score by the value you are moving to;
otherwise, increment your score by the value you are moving to.
Can you find positive integers A, B, and C, as well as a pair of trips, that satisfy the criteria above? How low can you get A + B + C?

Please format your entry by concatenating your values for A, B, and C, followed by your a1-to-f6 tour, followed by your a6-to-f1 tour. For example, “1,2,253,a1,b3,c5,d3,f4,d5,f6,a6,c5,a4,b2,c4,d2,f1” would be a properly formatted entry.

To qualify for the leaderboard your value for A + B + C must be less than 50.
